# WordGame
Small language word game.

● How much time was invested
Around 7-8 hours were invested in the development of this project.

● How was the time distributed (concept, model layer, view(s), game mechanics)
Architecture and design patterns : 40-50%
Programmatic views : 30%
Game logic : 20-30%

● Decisions made to solve certain aspects of the game
Probability of occurrence of correct pair is 25%. This logic was developed by creating a sub array of three random pairs and one correct pair. 

● Decisions made because of restricted time
Code can be further refactored
More unit tests can be written for specifically game logic.

● What would be the first thing to improve or add if there had been more time
Will improve abstractions
Will write more unit tests
